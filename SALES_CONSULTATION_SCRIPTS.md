Think of this as insurance for your team's safety. Can you really afford NOT to have professional labeling?"

### Timing Objection
**Objection:** "We need to think about it."

**Response:** "I completely understand wanting to make an informed decision. But let me ask you this: What if there's an electrical emergency tomorrow? What if an inspector shows up next week? Every electrical accident is preventable, but only if we act before it happens.

I've seen too many facilities wait until after an incident to implement professional labeling. Don't let that be you. Your team's safety can't wait for the perfect timing."

### Authority Objection
**Objection:** "I need to check with my manager/boss."

**Response:** "Absolutely, electrical safety decisions should involve key stakeholders. Let me help you present this to [manager/boss]:

The key points to share:
- Every electrical accident is preventable with professional labeling

Would it be helpful if I joined a call with [manager/boss] to answer any technical questions about electrical safety requirements?"

### DIY Objection

The question isn't whether you CAN make labels—it's whether homemade labels will protect your team when it matters most. Is saving a few dollars worth risking your team's safety?"
